<h1 style="text-align: center">Type Challenges Solutions</h1>

My solutions to the Typescript code challenges found in the [type-challenges repo](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges).

Where possible, solutions don't use any utility types provided by `Typescript` itself, instead rewriting them using base TS syntax.

Uses utils provided by `type-challenges` such as `Expect` & `Equals` to unit test the types.
